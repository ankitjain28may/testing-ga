It will first check the local cache for a semver match. 
The hosted images have been updated with the latest of each 
LTS from v8, v10, v12, and v14. self-hosted machines will benefit 
from the cache as well only downloading once. It will pull LTS
versions from node-versions releases and on miss or failure, 
it will fall back to the previous behavior of download directly 
from node dist.

The node-version input is optional. If not supplied, node 
which is in your PATH will be used. However, this action will 
still register problem matchers and support auth features. So 
setting up the node environment is still a valid scenario 
without downloading and caching versions.
